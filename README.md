# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis
This  project delves into the prevalence of depression and anxiety across genders, the factors influencing the seeking of medical assistance for mental health concerns and the predictive relationships between these indicators and the occurrence of panic attacks among students. 
The primary objective is to explore intricate relationships between depression, anxiety, and panic attacks by employing machine learning models such as  XGBoost classifier,Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.
Comparative analyses of model performance metrices will identify the most effective model for predicting panic attacks within the student population.
This comprehensive examination aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and contribute valuable insights to academic institutions and healthcare professionals
The student mental health.csv dataset is taken from Kaggle
